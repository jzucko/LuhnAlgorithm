verify_card_number function:

This function takes a credit card number as input and verifies its validity using the Luhn algorithm.
It initializes variables to store the sum of odd and even digits.
The card number is reversed to simplify processing from right to left.
Odd digits are selected by taking every other digit starting from the last digit.
Even digits are selected by taking every other digit starting from the second-to-last digit.
The function iterates through the odd digits and calculates their sum.
For even digits, each digit is doubled, and if the result is greater than or equal to 10, the digits of the result are summed.
Finally, the total sum of digits is calculated, and the function returns True if the total modulo 10 equals 0, indicating a valid card number.

main function:

This is the entry point of the program.
An example card number is defined.
The card number is translated to remove hyphens and spaces for consistency.
The verify_card_number function is called with the translated card number, and the result is printed as "VALID!" if True or "INVALID!" if False.

if __name__ == "__main__": block:

This block ensures that the main function is executed only if the script is run directly (not imported as a module). It's a common Python idiom to prevent executing code when importing a script as a module in another script.
